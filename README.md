# E-Book Backend Design




## Features

- get all books
- authentication
- get single book by id
- CRUD Operations
- cloudinary for media managment 


## Lessons Learned

while building this project main goal was to build restful api's and I succesfully implemented that with Authentication & Authorization. Incorporate testing from the start to ensure smooth operations, especially when handling crucial data like user accounts or book inventory. Plan for horizontal scalability and consider microservices or modular architecture as the user base grows.
